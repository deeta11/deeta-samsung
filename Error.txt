TYPE ERROR-
    A TypeError happens when you try to do something with a value that isnâ€™t allowed for its type. For example, trying to add a number to a word.
        Example:
            x = "hello"
            y = 5
            print(x + y)

NAME ERROR-
    A NameError happens when you try to use a variable or function that hasn't been defined.
        Example:
            print(x)  # NameError: name 'x' is not defined
